# SPHERE
! This program uses my custom Atom Engine library that is not public
yet so this is why I privided an executable but if you want to compile the code,
I advise you to use a library like [glfw](https://www.glfw.org/) or any C/C++ library that let you use OpenGL
directly.

So this little project is a rotating graduated sphere (heavily) inspired by [the chart sphere of Astrolog](https://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/ast3d.htm).
